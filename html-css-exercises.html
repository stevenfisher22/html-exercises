        Here's what I like about lists:
        <ul>
            <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
            <li>That's about it</li>
            <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        When you make a list, do it in this order:
        <ol>
            <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
            <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
            <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                </ul>
            <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
        </ol>

            <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
            <li><i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</i></li>
            <li><b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</b></li>
